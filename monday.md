#Intro to Scala
- Java without the crusty parts
- Standard Int Double String, also LIST, super flexible, can interact with all contents super easily, in much the same way you can a string in other languages
- You CAN define types when defining val's but its not necessary (it tries to be smart) 
- SBT = Simple Build Tool < builds the things for you
- the last line is always the return, no need for explicit returns
  - Anything wrapped in curly braces is an expresion (last line is return)
- Its all about the expressions gives great flexibility because all nested expressions are recursive
- Lists
  - Linked and immutable are most important attributes
  - foreach, reduce, map allow you to pull values out of long lists, can work directly with lists like we are used to working with functions

- Case Classes
  - Special class type taking advantage of immutability great for working with data
