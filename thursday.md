# Speeding up the web with PHP 7
- Some Rasmus dude, seems to know a lot about PHP
- Original Intention "A C api for the web"
  - Turns out people are lazy and wanted to do everything in the templating language
- Symlink prod /var/www/a /var/www/b swap case, shared opcache php8 figures it out
- Most fatals turned to exceptions!! Finally! But have to remember to litter your code with try/catch
- A lot of PHP4 stuff finally dropped completely so be hesitant about upgrading really old code


# You Code Like A Sysadmin
