# Speeding up the web with PHP 7
- Some Rasmus dude, seems to know a lot about PHP
- Original Intention "A C api for the web"
  - Turns out people are lazy and wanted to do everything in the templating language
- Symlink prod /var/www/a /var/www/b swap case, shared opcache php8 figures it out
- Most fatals turned to exceptions!! Finally! But have to remember to litter your code with try/catch
- A lot of PHP4 stuff finally dropped completely so be hesitant about upgrading really old code


# You Code Like A Sysadmin
- Imposter Syndrome
- Started out in middle of nowhere with little access to tech
- Went to college not ready to come head to head with tech
- A Turbo Pascal class later with a dash of C, thought he'd never be a programmer
  - Got picked to write the docs for his OS class
- Long story short, he became a sysadmin
  - picked up perl and shell scripting
- Wrote a really long perl hell comedy sports troup app
  - BUT it works and people still use it 10 years later
- BUT all the sudden a windows sysadmin job becomes a rails dev job
  - ended up writing a lot of small tools to solve internal needs
    - because nature abhors a vacuum

- Standards for being GOOD are really really high
- Why to keep building with such high standards if you know / think you suck?
- What if code is means, not the end
- If code ends up being useful you'll get a chance to fix it
- If you prematurely optimize it you'll never ship it
- Unwritten code helps no one
- But wait, if you have the ability USE IT
- Good code better than bad code bad code better than no code
- Decide who you want to listen to, users or haters
